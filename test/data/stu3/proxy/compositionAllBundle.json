Notary Statements or                                Oaths are often used to confirm a written statement, known as an                                affidavit, for use in court, estate or land title transactions. <br/> A notary public must positively identify the person requesting                                notarization.

The person requesting                                this notarial act must personally appear before the notary and sign                                the document in the presence of the notary.

If at some point in the future I am                                    declared incompetent, I DO NOT want to be allowed to override these preferences. I want                                    my doctors to follow the preferences I express in this document. </span><br/><br/> <span> <span> My Advance Care Goals </span><br/><br/> If I am so sick or seriously injured that I cannot express my own medical treatment                                preferences, and if I am not expected to live without additional treatment for my illness,                                disease, condition or injury, then I want my medical care team to know that these are the                                things that are most important to me: </span><br/> <ol> <li>Being at peace my with God</li> <li>Being able to feed, bathe, and take care of myself</li> <li>Being free from pain</li> <li>Resolving conflicts</li> <li>Being with my family</li> <li>Not being a financial burden to my family</li> </ol><br/> <span> If I am having significant pain or suffering, I would like my doctors to consult a Supportive                                and Palliative Care Team to help treat my physical, emotional and spiritual discomfort, and                                to support my family. </span><br/><br/> <span> My Preferences in Specific Circumstances </span><br/><br/> <span> In addition to the general advance care goals provided above, below are specific treatment                                    preferences with respect to certain specific circumstances or situations. </span><br/><br/> <span> If my health ever deteriorates due to a terminal illness, and my doctors believe I will not be                                able to interact meaningfully with my family, friends, or surroundings, I prefer that they stop                                all life-sustaining treatments and let me die as gently as possible. I realize that I will not                                receive life-sustaining treatments including but not limited to breathing machines, blood                                transfusions, dialysis, heart machines, and IV drugs to keep my heart working. I also realize                                that medical personnel will not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and they will                                allow me to die naturally. </span><br/><br/> <span> If I have a severe, irreversible brain injury or illness and can’t dress, feed, or bathe myself,                                or communicate my medical wishes, but doctors can keep me alive in this condition for a                                long period of time, I would like for them to keep trying life-sustaining treatments for 2                                months. </span><br/><br/> <span> Although I understand that, depending on the situation and circumstances, medical                                personnel may not be able to follow my wishes, here are my general thoughts on                                cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): </span> <br/><br/> <span> I want CPR attempted unless my doctor says I have a terminal illness or a severe,                                irreversible brain injury, OR I have little chance of long-term survival if my heart or breathing                                stop, and an attempt to resuscitate me would cause me significant suffering, OR it simply                                will not work in my condition. </span> <br/><br/> <span> <span> Other Instructions </span> <br/><br/> If it were possible to choose, here is where I would like to spend my final days:                                At home. I would like to receive hospice care at home if possible.                                Unless I have stated otherwise somewhere else in this uADD™, I understand that my                                healthcare agent may reconsider my medical treatment choices expressed above in light of                                my other instructions contained elsewhere in this uADD™ or new medical information. </span><br/><br/> </div>"

Notary Statements or                                Oaths are often used to confirm a written statement, known as an                                affidavit, for use in court, estate or land title transactions. <br/> A notary public must positively identify the person requesting                                notarization.

The person requesting                                this notarial act must personally appear before the notary and sign                                the document in the presence of the notary.
